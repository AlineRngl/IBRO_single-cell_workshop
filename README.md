# IBRO single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) workshop
The goal of this workshop is to help participants learn how to use publicly available scRNA-seq datasets and perform basic analysis in R using Seurat. No prior coding experience is required. An introduction to R, examples of scRNA-seq analysis, and hands-on exercises will reinforce key concepts and guide participants through a typical RNA-seq workflow.

# Requirements
Access to Rstudio

# Software
[R](https://www.r-project.org/)

[Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

In R, install the following libraries (in case they are not already installed):
* seurat
* ggplot2
* data.table
* cowplot
* scales
* dplyr

You can also install them using the R package [here](https://github.com/AlineRngl/IBRO_single-cell_workshop/tree/main/Seurat/IntroToSeurat/InstallRLibrariesPackage), but the library devtools needs to be installed first.
